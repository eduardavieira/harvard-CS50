# Problem Set 0

In this assignment it is required to implement in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) a project of our choice.

In my case I chose to implement a three-level interactive game with two Sprites: an Elf and a Mermaid. The goal is to collect as many potions as possible to help the Mermaid.
