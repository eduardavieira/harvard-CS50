# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Problems and Final Project developed for the course Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

To complete it I studied all of the CS50 lectures and available documents on the [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).


## [Problem Set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/0/)

In this assignment it was required to implement in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) a project of our choice.

In my case I chose to implement a three-level interactive game with two Sprites: an Elf and a Mermaid. The goal is to collect as many potions as possible to help the Mermaid.

## [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/)

[Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/cash/)

## [Problem Set 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/)

[Readability](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/readability/)

[Substitution](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/substitution/)
